# Counting Money

A program that outputs the total amount of money a user has after receiving number of bills and coins. The program asks the user how many of each bill and coin type they have in the console, using USD. It starts with $20 bils and ends with pennies. There is also an option for the user to input any extra amount they want to add to the final total. Their total is printed to the console.

This project uses Java. This project gave me experience with user input, calculations in Java, and using Repl.it as an IDE.
